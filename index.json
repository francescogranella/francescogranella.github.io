Our findings suggest that climate change disproportionately affects the poorer segments of the population within countries, even after accounting for a country’s ability to adapt to climate impacts, while richer households suffer lower damages. In the reference scenario without additional climate action (3.6°C warming), we estimate that climate impacts could lead to an increase in the Gini index by up to six percentage points, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa. We project impacts to 2100 through the RICE50+ model and estimate the income elasticity of impacts within countries.

Climate change will alter the distribution of ecosystems around the world and change the flow of these benefits2,3. However, the specific implications of ecosystem changes for human welfare remain unclear, as they depend on the nature of these changes, the value of the affected benefits and the extent to which communities rely on natural systems for their well-being4. Here we estimate country-level changes in economic production and the value of non-market ecosystem benefits resulting from climate-change-induced shifts in terrestrial vegetation cover, as projected by dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) driven by general circulation climate models. Our results show that the annual population-weighted mean global flow of non-market ecosystem benefits valued in the wealth accounts of the World Bank will be reduced by 9.2% in 2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP2-6.0 with respect to the baseline no climate change scenario and that the global population-weighted average change in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100 is −1.3% of the baseline GDP.

Leveraging on the predictive power of machine learning models and exploiting the reduction in non-agricultural emissions during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, we analyze the complex relationship between NH3, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA). We find that even substantially large reduction in precursor emissions may not deliver large drops in secondary inorganic PM. While NO2 plays a significant role in urban environments, in rural areas where NH3 levels are high, both NO2 and NH3 contribute to SIA formation. This emphasizes the importance of considering both NH3 and NO2 emissions in policies controlling secondary inorganic PM, as reductions in both precursors may be necessary for significant improvements. The study provides insights into the interplay between agricultural practices and air pollution, more specifically the NH3–NO2 regime and its implications for effective air pollution control strategies in Lombardy.\n","date":1702771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702771200,"objectID":"af6f8742b9bd5cbf5e782e290b3e707c","permalink":"/project/inhale/","publishdate":"2023-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/inhale/","section":"project","summary":"Agriculture can be a major source of secondary inorganic particulate matter (PM).

Persistent effect of temperature on GDP identified from lower frequency temperature variability. Environmental Research Letters, 17(8), 084038\nIt is well established that temperature variability affects a range of outcomes relevant to human welfare, including health, emotion and mood, and productivity across a number of economic sectors. However, a critical and still unresolved empirical question is whether temperature variation has a long-lasting effect on economic productivity and, therefore, whether damages compound over time in response to long-lived changes in temperature expected with climate change. Several studies have identified a relationship between temperature and GDP, but empirical evidence as to the persistence of these effects is still weak. This paper presents a novel approach to isolate the persistent component of temperature effects on output using lower frequency temperature variation. The effects are heterogenous across countries but collectively, using three different GDP datasets, we find evidence of persistent effects, implying temperature affects the determinants of economic growth, not just economic productivity. This in turn means that the aggregate effects of climate change on GDP may be far larger and far more uncertain than currently represented in integrated assessment models used to calculate the social cost of carbon.\n","date":1643241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643241600,"objectID":"4450968a7e3ea57e64ebe425d4e9babd","permalink":"/project/tempgdp/","publishdate":"2022-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tempgdp/","section":"project","summary":"We present a novel approach to isolate the persistent component of temperature effects on output using lower frequency temperature variation.
