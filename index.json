However, a critical and still unresolved empirical question is whether temperature variation has a long-lasting effect on economic productivity and, therefore, whether damages compound over time in response to long-lived changes in temperature expected with climate change. Several studies have identified a relationship between temperature and GDP, but empirical evidence as to the persistence of these effects is still weak. This paper presents a novel approach to isolate the persistent component of temperature effects on output using lower frequency temperature variation. The effects are heterogenous across countries but collectively, using three different GDP datasets, we find evidence of persistent effects, implying temperature affects the determinants of economic growth, not just economic productivity. This in turn means that the aggregate effects of climate change on GDP may be far larger and far more uncertain than currently represented in integrated assessment models used to calculate the social cost of carbon.\n","date":1643241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643241600,"objectID":"4450968a7e3ea57e64ebe425d4e9babd","permalink":"/project/tempgdp/","publishdate":"2022-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tempgdp/","section":"project","summary":"We present a novel approach to isolate the persistent component of temperature effects on output using lower frequency temperature variation.

We use difference in differences regression models that compare outcomes of contributing and non-contributing firms before and after the ban. We document three findings. First, before the ban, contributing firms won 20 to 25% more procurement tenders per year than non-contributing firms. Second, the ban on corporate contributions significantly decreased the number of national procurement contracts won by contributing firms by 2 to 11 percentage points, a magnitude that only partially offset their previous advantage. Third, firms previously making large contributions circumvent the ban in both national and local elections with donations from owners and board members. Together, our findings suggest that a ban on corporate contributions have limited effects on the average influence of contributing firms when there are mechanisms to circumvent the ban.\nPresentations: MPSA 2020 (canceled), EPSA (2021), APSA (2020)\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"c1071874cefba78eebfd623ef24a729c","permalink":"/project/donations/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/donations/","section":"project","summary":"Are bans on electoral contributions from firms effective?
