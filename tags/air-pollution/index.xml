      <title>COVID-19 lockdown only partially alleviates health impacts of air pollution in Northern Italy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Published on &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Lara Aleluia Reis, Valentina Bosetti, and Massimo Tavoni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the reduction in pollution caused by a sudden change in emissions is complicated by the
confounding effect of weather variations. We propose an approach based on machine learning to
build counterfactual scenarios that address the effect of weather and apply it to the COVID-19
lockdown of Lombardy, Italy. We show that the lockdown reduced background concentrations of
PM2.5 by 3.84 µg m−3 (16%) and NO2 by 10.85 µg m−3 (33%). Improvement in air quality saved
at least 11% of the years of life lost and 19% of the premature deaths attributable to COVID-19 in
the region during the same period. The analysis highlights the benefits of improving air quality and
the need for an integrated policy response addressing the full diversity of emission sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>You Can’t Run from Air Pollution: The Effect of Fine Particulate Matter on Physical Tasks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A large share of the world’s population is employed in manual labor. This paper estimates the effect of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) on purely physical tasks analyzing half a million amateur track and field competition results, a setting where cognition plays a minor role. Exploiting the panel nature of the data and high dimensional fixed effects, I find that a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM 2.5 reduces performance by 1% of a standard deviation. The effect grows with the duration of effort, indicating that productivity losses may be larger for occupations requiring low-intensity and sustained effort, such as construction workers.&lt;/p&gt;
