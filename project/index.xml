      <title>Persistent Effect of Temperature on GDP identified from Lower Frequency Temperature Variability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bastien-Olvera, B. A., Granella, F., &amp;amp; Moore, F. C. (2022). Persistent effect of temperature on GDP identified from lower frequency temperature variability. &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;, 17(8), 084038&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well established that temperature variability affects a range of outcomes relevant to human welfare, including health, emotion and mood, and productivity across a number of economic sectors. However, a critical and still unresolved empirical question is whether temperature variation has a long-lasting effect on economic productivity and, therefore, whether damages compound over time in response to long-lived changes in temperature expected with climate change. Several studies have identified a relationship between temperature and GDP, but empirical evidence as to the persistence of these effects is still weak. This paper presents a novel approach to isolate the persistent component of temperature effects on output using lower frequency temperature variation. The effects are heterogenous across countries but collectively, using three different GDP datasets, we find evidence of persistent effects, implying temperature affects the determinants of economic growth, not just economic productivity. This in turn means that the aggregate effects of climate change on GDP may be far larger and far more uncertain than currently represented in integrated assessment models used to calculate the social cost of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COVID-19 lockdown only partially alleviates health impacts of air pollution in Northern Italy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Granella, F., Reis, L. A., Bosetti, V., &amp;amp; Tavoni, M. (2021). COVID-19 lockdown only partially alleviates health impacts of air pollution in Northern Italy. &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;, 16(3), 035012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the reduction in pollution caused by a sudden change in emissions is complicated by the
confounding effect of weather variations. We propose an approach based on machine learning to
build counterfactual scenarios that address the effect of weather and apply it to the COVID-19
lockdown of Lombardy, Italy. We show that the lockdown reduced background concentrations of
PM2.5 by 3.84 µg m−3 (16%) and NO2 by 10.85 µg m−3 (33%). Improvement in air quality saved
at least 11% of the years of life lost and 19% of the premature deaths attributable to COVID-19 in
the region during the same period. The analysis highlights the benefits of improving air quality and
the need for an integrated policy response addressing the full diversity of emission sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heterogeneous Effects of Air Pollution on Physical Tasks: Evidence from Amateur Track and Field</title>
      <link>/project/track/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although a large share of the world’s population is employed in manual labor, our understanding of the productivity costs of air pollution for physically intensive work remains limited. This paper estimates the effect of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) on purely physical tasks by analyzing half a million amateur track and field competition results, a setting where cognition plays a minor role. Exploiting the panel nature of the data and high dimensional fixed effects, I find that a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM 2.5 reduces performance by 1% of a standard deviation. The effect grows with the duration of effort, indicating that productivity losses may be larger for occupations requiring low-intensity and sustained effort, such as construction workers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Campaign money for nothing? Understanding the consequences of a ban on corporate contributions: evidence from Brazil.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We study the effects of the 2015 ban on corporate contributions in Brazil on the allocation of procurement contracts and the frequency of large personal contributions of corporate members, a channel to circumvent the ban. We use difference in differences regression models that compare outcomes of contributing and non-contributing firms before and after the ban. We document three findings. First, before the ban, contributing firms won 20 to 25% more procurement tenders per year than non-contributing firms. Second, the ban on corporate contributions significantly decreased the number of national procurement contracts won by contributing firms by 2 to 11 percentage points, a magnitude that only partially offset their previous advantage. Third, firms previously making large contributions circumvent the ban in both national and local elections with donations from owners and board members. Together, our findings suggest that a ban on corporate contributions have limited effects on the average influence of contributing firms when there are mechanisms to circumvent the ban.&lt;/p&gt;
